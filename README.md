# Aspen Plus-Python Connection Example

This repo contains an Aspen Plus-Python connection example.

Differently from Aspen-HYSYS, accesing the variable paths in Aspen Plus is very straight forward. Therefore, the connection can be made directly easily (without the spreadsheets trick of the [Aspen_HYSYS_Python repo](https://github.com/edgarsmdn/Aspen_HYSYS_Python)).

The code is just a couple of lines long that are self-explanatory and have comments too.

This is an example of where you might want to look for the variable paths of interest:

To get the path of the variable of interest, there is a small trick to that can be done to avoid looking through the variable tree manually(time intense). You can just copy the variable of interest such as a the mole fraction of heptane, go to Variable Explorer, and click on "Find Clipboard Variable" to be redirected automatically to the correct path by Aspen Plus.
